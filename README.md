- Iteration1 (Data Collection).xlsx - This file contains the initial set of literature gathered from multiple academic databases using predefined search queries.
- Iteration2 (Deduplication).xlsx - The file contains the dataset after removing duplicate entries to ensure each reference appears only once.
- Iteration3 (Preliminary Filtering).xlsx - The file contains the initial filtering result by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to the collected literature, based on the title, keyword and abstract.
- Iteration4 (Detailed Screening).xlsx -  The file contains the result after a thorough review  on the filtered literature to ensure it meets the criteria, required quality and relevance.
- Iteration5 (Snowballing).xlsx -  The file contains the additional identified literature  through snowballing by examining references in the relevant papers.
- Iteration6 (final).xlsx - This file contains the final set of literature after multiple iterations of filtering and review.
- Score.xlsx -  The final set of selected papers has been assessed and scored based on predefined quality assessment criteria, and the results are presented here.
